# 🔍 CodeRecon

**Engineering-first repository reconnaissance and architectural auditing.**

CodeRecon is a pragmatic CLI tool designed to bridge the gap between documentation and reality. It performs deep static analysis of codebases to identify functional mapping, architectural risks, and implementation gaps using local intelligence.

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. From PyPI
Install the core tool directly via pip:
```bash
pip install coderecon
```
### 2. Local LLM Setup
CodeRecon requires Ollama for its reasoning capabilities.

Download Ollama from ollama.com.

Pull the required model:

```Bash
ollama pull llama3
```
### 🛠️ Usage
Quick Start
Analyze your current directory and get a structural breakdown:

```Bash
coderecon explain .
```
Architectural Mapping
Generate a topology map to see functional roles and risk density:

```Bash
coderecon topology .
```
### Formal Audit
Generate a persistent RECON_REPORT.md with technical specs and Mermaid diagrams:

```Bash
coderecon report .
```
###Remote Audit
Analyze a GitHub repository without cloning it manually:

```Bash
coderecon explain [https://github.com/user/project](https://github.com/user/project)
```
### 🏗️ Architectural Bucketing
The tool automatically classifies files into functional roles:

Entry Points: System dispatchers and main hooks.

Core: High-logic modules with central dependencies.

Data Layer: Schemas, models, and database logic.

External Integrations: API clients and LLM wrappers.

Utilities: Helper modules and reporting logic.

### 🛡️ Privacy & Philosophy
100% Local: Your code never leaves your machine. Analysis is performed via local AST parsing and local LLM inference.

No-Cap: Prioritizes hard file data over AI "guesses."

Ephemeral: Remote clones are stored in temp directories and aggressively deleted after use.
